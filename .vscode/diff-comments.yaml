    ✓ The pipeline should probably be updated: do we need to integrate this into
    the interpreter? Is there any risk that the formatter would remove any line
    breaks in the free text string?

    ✓ This is in the wrong location - it appears after the optional comment parse,
    which can't happen at all, and it should be in its own function. Also, this
    should probably be moved to the scanInfoLine2.ts file.

    ✓ Why are you not calling `rhythm()`? Do not omit the rhythms, they should be
    included in the tooken stream.

    ✓ Are we sure that this is being integrated in the parser and in the semantic
    analyzer and in the interpreter? How is this interpreted in the abcjs
    implementation? we need to use it as reference

    ✓ This and the R decoration should probably be integrated in the whole
    pipeline all the way up to the interpreter level: parser (already
    included?), formatter, and semantic analyzer, and interpreter. This means
    that we need to check the implementation of abcjs to find the corresponding
    interpreter expression and use it as reference.

    ✓ I'm undecided about whether or not we should be pushing two tokens for this.
    Also, this is a new expression, and it's not been integrated in the whole
    pipeline: it's not in the parser, it's not in the formatter and it's not in
    the interpreter, and it's not in the semantic analyzer. This needs fixing
    specifically because: the formatter will insert a WS between the decoration
    and the dotter_slur tokens, which will result in an invalid re-parse after
    formatting. This is terrible design.
